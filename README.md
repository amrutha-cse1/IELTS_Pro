## Development Process

I started by researching modern education website designs and created wireframes for each section. The color palette was chosen to convey trust and professionalism while maintaining visual appeal. I focused on mobile-first development and tested extensively across different screen sizes.

The most challenging part was implementing the smooth scrolling navigation and ensuring the testimonial cards had the right visual hierarchy. I'm particularly proud of the hover effects and the responsive navigation system.

This project demonstrates my understanding of modern React development practices, component-based architecture, and responsive design principles.
